So, the total sum of all these numbers will be 144 72 216 at unit position.Alternate MethodOption 1 last digit even2 odd numbers out of 3 can be arranged in 3P2 3!

Yes, you heard it right thats over 100 crore Indian rupees a year. Having read this in the newspaper, Mr. Ramesh from Hyderabad decides to get his two sons to join a culinary school. There are N schools in total, with varying distances D from his home and varying fees F they collect. As the number of schools is huge, he would like to prepare a list of preferred schools before he starts his school hunt.Mr. Ramesh prefers school X over school Y if X is at a distance less than or equal to Y and X collects fees less than or equal to Y. Also, a school cannot be preferred over itself. Consider a set A of schools a school X is termed Special A if there is no school in A that is preferred over X. Max Special A is the maximal subset of A such that every school in Max Special A is Special A. He wants to consider only some schools, based on how much fee he can pay and at most how far he can send his sons. But he has a lot of such queries for you, each of them specifying 3 conditions, maxDistance he can send his sons no farther than maxDistance, maxFee he can pay at most maxFee, and minFee he wants to pay at least minFee.In each of his queries, he wants you to consider only a set S of schools that satisfy the given 3 conditions, and all you need to do is just count the maximum number of schools that can be in a Max Special S.",
